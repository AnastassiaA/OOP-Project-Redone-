# OOP-Project-Redone-
(In progress) 

The Home & Away Institute (H&AI) is an Educational Institution that specializes in offering Distance
Learning courses. The Chairman of the H&AI has requested that a program be created to allow, students
in the Distance Learning Group (DLG), the opportunity to take multiple choice online tests. As the
Manager of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Department, you are in charge of
presenting the prototype system at the next meeting of the Board.
The prototype should allow the student the chance to select the course he/she wants to complete. The test
should take the form of a multiple choice test, consisting of ten (10) questions. The questions should be
randomly selected from a question databank and should be related to the selected course.
